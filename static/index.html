Web side:

instantiate xterm
instantiate websocket
On socket msg receive:
    write data to term

Maybe split pty into pieces such as bottom bar and 
buffer contents and send seperately to save a little network


Server side:
child of fork will do nothing but the subprocess for attaching
to the tmux session.  force size at this point? 

Parent process will go on to start a flask server that serves
the static content and also starts the websocket.  Not sure how
I'm going to implement the hot-reload of the data.  inotify?
